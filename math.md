# Calculating the Mortgage payment

Follow the formula M = P((r(1+r)^n)/((1+r)^(n)-1))

Where
- M is the monthly repayment
- P is the loan principal
- r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
- n is the number of payments (loan term in years multiplied by 12)

Additional info:
- for a monthly interest rate of 5.25%, the monthly rate is (5.25)/(100*12) = 0.004375.
- for a 25 year term, the number of payments would be 25 x 12 = 300.

With this information in mind, let's plug the values of the example in to see if the calculations are correct:

M = (300,000)((0.004375(1+0.004375)^300)/(1+0.004375)^(300)-1) = 1797.74

This matches the example, the calculation is right.

Using the result, multiply it by n to find the total repayment amount:

1979.74 * 300 = 539,322, which also matches the example.

To find the interest only, take the total repayment and subtract the intial mortgage amount from it.

539,322 - 300,000 = 239,322.94.
